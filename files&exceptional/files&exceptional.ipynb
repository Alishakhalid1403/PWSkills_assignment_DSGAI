    "#Q1. Multithreading vs Multiprocessing:\n",
    "    #1. Multithreading: is preferable when tasks are I/O-bound (e.g., file handling, web scraping) since it doesn't require heavy CPU usage. Threads share memory space, making communication faster.\n",
    "    #2. Multiprocessing: is better for CPU-bound tasks (e.g., heavy computation), as it can fully utilize multiple CPU cores. Each process runs independently with its own memory space.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q2. Process Pool:\n",
    "   #A process pool is a collection of worker processes that execute tasks in parallel. It helps manage multiple processes efficiently by distributing tasks among a limited number of processes rather than creating new ones for every task.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q3. Multiprocessing:\n",
    "   # Multiprocessing allows parallel execution of tasks by creating separate processes, each with its own memory space. It's used in Python to achieve concurrent execution of CPU-bound tasks, taking full advantage of multiple cores.\n",
